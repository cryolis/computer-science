# CompSci.js

## Computer Science the Modern Javascript Way

Algorithms and data structures are essential foundations if you ever want to advance beyond the #NerdKeepers of the professional development world. With the latest additions to JS, not only is it possible to implement these tools in a way that matches other typical CompSci languages (ex Java); with the additions of langauge extensions like the `[symbol.iterator]` JS is capable of prividing an even better DX (Developer Experience).

## What's the Point?

Self-taught or academically educated. If you have aspirations to be a professional deveoper, eventually you'll need to know this. Instead of wasting time/effort on outdated courses, blogs, libraries, etc; the goal of this repo is to provide everything you need to get started using only modern best practices.
